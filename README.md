# The Investigation of DNA Methylation Differences between Mice Blood and Liver Datasets to Understand Epigenetics Effects with Age

Drug metabolism declines with age and older adults are at greater risk of adverse drug reactions. The
research described here aimed to understand the similarities between age-related DNA methylation
patterns at drug-metabolizing genes in mice blood and liver DNA. Our goal is to evaluate the potential for
blood DNA methylation states to serve as biomarkers of drug metabolism gene activity in the liver. The
mice blood and liver CpG data were obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and analyzed using gene-matching algorithms on
RStudio and the GeneOverlap package. It was hypothesized that there would be significant overlap
between age-related changes in the mice blood and liver genes. There was a small but significant overlap
between the different tissues with a p-value of 2.1e-13. We found that the following drug-metabolizing
genes changed with age in both tissue types: Abca8a, Gstp1, Gstp2, Abca1, and Abca4.
